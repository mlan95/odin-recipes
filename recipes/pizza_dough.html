        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This pizza dough recipe is a quick and easy way to enhance your favourite homemade pizza. I love having restaurant style pizza crust made from home with my favourite ingrediants.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1-1/3 cups warm water(100-110°F></li>
                <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>3/4 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>3-1/2 cups all purpose flower</li>
                <li>Sprinkle of cornmeal</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. </li>
                <li>Using a stand mixer with dough hook attachment knead for 5 minutes. If you don't have a stand mixer knead on a floured surface.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. </li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</li>
                <li>Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle. Lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. </li>
                <li>over dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings.</li>
                <li>Top & bake the pizza: To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
